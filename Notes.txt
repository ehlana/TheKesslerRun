We’ll create a three-tier resource economy that’s grounded, modular, and expandable.

🌍 Step 1: Conceptual Flow

Each salvage → refines into → base materials → which can either:

be sold (common or hazardous waste),

fabricated into drone parts / modules,

or spent on upgrade tree materials.

Here’s the overall structure:
Debris Field
   ↓
Raw Salvage (11 we already defined)
   ↓
Recycling Facility
   ↓
Refined Resources (Tier 2)
   ↓
→ Sell for credits
→ Use in fabrication (Tier 3 components)
→ Use in upgrades / research

Step 2: Tier 2 – Refined Materials

Each “raw salvage” breaks down into one or more of these.
These are the base materials of your in-game economy — simple, logical, and reusable.

Refined Material ID	Display Name	Description	Common Uses
metal_ingots	Processed Alloys	Reclaimed aluminum/titanium blends.	Drone chassis, hull plating
carbon_fibres	Carbon Fibres	Graphene composites.	Lightweight frames, tether repair
ceramic_mesh	Ceramic Mesh	Heat-resistant ceramic layers.	Thruster housings, armor
circuit_boards	Circuit Boards	Basic electronic components.	Drone control units
quantum_chips	Quantum Chips	Advanced processors from AI nodes.	Research upgrades, command AI
solar_cells	Solar Cells	Reusable photovoltaic plates.	Power modules, orbital relays
coolant_fluid	Coolant Fluid	Thermal transfer gels and fluids.	Reactor, repair drones
radioactives	Radioactive Elements	Enriched isotopes.	Fusion cores, sell (hazardous waste)
volatile_compounds	Volatile Compounds	Propellant residues and oxidizers.	Fuel boosters, high-risk sale
optics	Optical Lenses	Precision glass and mirrors.	Sensor modules, drone vision systems
encrypted_data	Encrypted Data	Recovered AI or mission logs.	Upgrade research, lore currency
scrap_artifacts	Scrap Artifacts	Culturally significant debris.	Sell to collectors / reputation gain

🔄 Step 3: Conversion Mapping

Here’s how your existing salvage types could refine:

Salvage Type	Recycles Into	Notes
structural_alloys	metal_ingots, ceramic_mesh	Standard station metals
superconductive_wire	circuit_boards, quantum_chips	Advanced electronics
photovoltaic_cells	solar_cells, optics	Energy collection materials
thermal_compounds	ceramic_mesh, coolant_fluid	Heat-resistant and fluid materials
composite_fibres	carbon_fibres, metal_ingots	Versatile and light structural
reactive_fuel	volatile_compounds, coolant_fluid	Propellants, dangerous
rare_isotopes	radioactives, quantum_chips	Core for upgrades, high sale value
optical_components	optics, circuit_boards	Precision lenses and scanners
data_cores	encrypted_data, quantum_chips	For upgrades, lore or research
defense_components	metal_ingots, circuit_boards, radioactives	Used in weapon or armor modules
historic_artifacts	scrap_artifacts	Sale/reputation only

🧩 Step 4: Tier 3 – Fabrication / Upgrade Uses

These are the “consumers” of the refined materials — they give the economy purpose.

Category	Examples	Resource Demands
Drone Frames	Scout Drone, Heavy Salvager, Collector Mk II	metal_ingots, carbon_fibres, circuit_boards
Modules	Thermal Shield, Auto-Repair Node, Fuel Scoop	ceramic_mesh, coolant_fluid, optics
Energy Systems	Solar Array, Reactor Core, Capacitor Bank	solar_cells, radioactives, superconductive_wire
Weapons / Defense	Micro Railgun, EMP Net	defense_components, metal_ingots, circuit_boards
Upgrades / Research	AI Core Expansion, Drone Coordination, Quantum Salvage Efficiency	encrypted_data, quantum_chips, radioactives
Sellable Waste	Volatile Compounds, Scrap Artifacts, Radioactives	Sell-only or hazardous contracts

💰 Step 5: Market Behaviour

You can then classify all resources for economy simulation:

Common (bulk, low-value)
metal_ingots, carbon_fibres, ceramic_mesh

Specialized (medium value)
optics, solar_cells, coolant_fluid, circuit_boards

Advanced (high value / rare)
quantum_chips, radioactives, encrypted_data

Sell-only (no fabrication)
volatile_compounds, scrap_artifacts
